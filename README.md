## 🚀 About Me

I'm a backend-focused Software Engineer who loves building systems that are clean, reliable, and built to scale.  
My strengths are in **TypeScript, Node.js, cloud architecture, AWS services, and distributed messaging systems**.

Over the past few years, I’ve:

- Built **event-driven microservices**  
- Built **queue retry pipelines** with AWS SQS, Lambda, and DLQs  
- Worked professionally in **Node.js / TypeScript / Express / AWS**  
- Gained experience with **CDK, IAM, KMS, infrastructure automation**   
- Developed a strong foundation in backend architecture + reliability  

I also bring a background in counseling & social work — which means I care deeply about **clarity, empathy, teamwork, and communication**.

When I'm not coding, I'm either reading horror novels, practicing drums 🥁, or discovering new indie games.
